## Questions that existing autotuning solutions have yet to address

- (Online) theoretical estimation of sampling complextiy for the formulated bayesian optimization problem.


## Promising ideas

- Use reinforcement learning for next sampling config generation. Reward increases as better or more volatile performance is observed.

- Or use GAN like strategy to generate training samples ?
